# Overview

From the past two decades, STEM subjects are gaining high importance as they are providing an opportunity for students to develop increasingly important 21st Century skills such as critical thinking, complex problem solving, communication and collaboration. STEM education is becoming even more important in preparing students for work in the technologically advancing world.

STEM subjects such as Science can be difficult to visualize. With the rapid development of information and communication technology, educators and researchers increasingly highlight the potential merits of using interactive computer simulations to improve STEM learning outcomes.

As a part of Coursera's Game design and development specialization, I have developed an interactive simulation of our Solar system with four planets including the Earth-Moon system in Unity3D. 

Below is the video of the interactive solar system simulation.
